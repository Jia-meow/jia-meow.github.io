* Designed a Q&A platform like Piazza with scalable Microservices Architecture

* Made REST APIs , built automatic Email notification service, supported Google OAth2, address autocomplete, used Travis-CI and Pytest   

* Built front end by Bootstrap and React, using JWT to maintain login status, used Fetch to get data from back end, placed static content on S3 and CloudFront to accelerate distribution

**Linux Kernel Hacking**
Operating System    
Columbia, 2018

* [Android orientation synchronization System call](https://github.com/zw2497/Android-Orientation-Synchronizer): Wrote an Android user-space daemon to pass device orientation info to kernel, used Wait Queue, Spinlock, IDR to allow multiple processes registering, destroying orientation events and getting notified when certain event happens    

* [Multi-core Weighted Round-Robin Scheduler](https://github.com/zw2497/Linux-Weight-Round-Robin-scheduler): An O (1) CPU Affinity Multicore Scheduler which supports keeping track of weight on each CPUs, idle load balancing by pulling tasks, assigned same CPU affinity on each thread groups

* [Simple Shell](https://github.com/zw2497/Linux-Simple-Shell): Implemented in C which supports built-in commands as well as `pipes, !, !string, history, chdir`

* [In-memory Proc File System](https://github.com/zw2497/Linux-Proc-File-System): Constructed a pseudo file system in Linux which can present process hierarchy in directory

[**Databass**](https://github.com/zw2497/DatabassEngine)       
a Python-based database for instruction      
Columbia, 2018       

* Implemented a Query Compiler which directly compiles SQL to Python code for execution. It supports operation such as Project, Scan, Filter, Count

* Added support on Offset, Limit, Orderby and Count function, implemented a Selinger Optimizer for multi-table join

        
**Deep Neural Network (Current Project)**      
Columbia, 2019        

* [Landmark Recognition](https://zw2497.github.io): Classify landmarks in Columbia using Keras, VGG16 with Fine-Tuning, support phone browsers using TensorFlow.js (Working on)

* [GANS tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow): Design GANS tutorial for incoming Tensorflow 2.0 such as DCGAN, CycleGAN (Working on)

* [Phoneme_recognition_with_neural_networks](https://github.com/zw2497/Keras_LSTM_Tutorial): Use LSTM training on TIMIT linguistic dataset for English speech recognition, train Auto Encoder for noise reduction (Working on)



[**Airlock**](https://zw2497.github.io)     
Embedded System    
UESTC, 2016            

* It is a Bluetooth lock for delivery packages sponsored by Chengdu Pangod Inc. 

* This smart lock has AES-128 encryption and GPS tracking. It supported BLE Stack using TI CC2541. Patent No. 2016201342833
