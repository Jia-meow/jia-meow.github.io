									<h1>Implantable ITO probes for optogenetics</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) thin films are commonly used for optoelectronics due to the combined properties of transparency and electrical conductivity. In previous work, the flexibility of ITO has been increased by PEDOT:PSS coating, which has been widely used in optical devices. Here, we tested the functionality of PEDOT:PSS/ITO electrodes in the use of electrophysiological recordings. The electrodes showed good biocompatibility and stability in saline solution, while the electrical conductivity was still limited. Thus, we designed a multilayer film on Parylene-C substrate with an integration of PEDOT:PSS/ITO/Ag/ITO structure. Silver (Ag) has excellent electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility and acceptable transparency when it is thin enough. The fabricated PEDOT:PSS/ITO/Ag/ITO thin film showed good adhesion between layers. The multilayer film showed remarkable reduced electrochemical impedance and wavelength-tunable transmittance. </p>
